 * Memory refers to the state information of a computing system, as it is kept
 * active in some physical structure. The term "memory" is used for the
 * information in physical systems which are fast (ie. RAM), as a distinction
 * from physical systems which are slow to access (ie. data storage). By design,
 * the term "memory" refers to temporary state devices, whereas the term
 * "storage" is reserved for permanent data.
