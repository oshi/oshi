OSHI is a free JNA-based (native) Operating System and Hardware Information library for Java.
It does not require the installation of any additional native libraries and aims to provide a
cross-platform implementation to retrieve system information, such as OS version, processes,
memory and CPU usage, disks and partitions, devices, sensors, etc.

Usage
-----
1. Include OSHI and its dependencies on your classpath.
   - We strongly recommend you add `oshi-core` as a dependency to your project dependency manager such as Maven or Gradle.  
   - For Android, you'll need to add the [AAR artifact for JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/blob/master/www/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.md#jna-on-android) and exclude OSHI's transitive (JAR) dependency.
2. Create a new instance of `SystemInfo`
3. Use the getters from `SystemInfo` to access hardware or operating system components, such as:

```java
SystemInfo si = new SystemInfo();
HardwareAbstractionLayer hal = si.getHardware();
CentralProcessor cpu = hal.getProcessor();
```

See [SystemInfoTest.java](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/oshi-core/src/test/java/oshi/SystemInfoTest.java) for examples.  To see sample output for your machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/oshi/oshi.git && cd oshi

./mvnw test-compile -pl oshi-core exec:java \
  -Dexec.mainClass="oshi.SystemInfoTest" \
  -Dexec.classpathScope="test"
```

Some settings are configurable in the [`oshi.properties`](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/oshi-core/src/main/resources/oshi.properties) file, which may also be manipulated using the [`GlobalConfig`](https://oshi.github.io/oshi/oshi-core/apidocs/oshi/util/GlobalConfig.html) class. This should be done at startup, as configuration is not thread-safe and OSHI does not guarantee re-reading the configuration during operation.

The `oshi-demo` artifact includes [several proof-of-concept examples](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/oshi-demo/src/main/java/oshi/demo/) of using OSHI to obtain information, including a basic Swing GUI.

How Can I Help?
---------------
[OSHI originated](https://code.dblock.org/2010/06/23/introducing-oshi-operating-system-and-hardware-information-java.html)
as a platform-independent library that did not require additional software and had a license compatible with
both open source and commercial products. We have developed a strong core of features on major Operating Systems,
but we would love for *you* to help by:
* Testing!  Our CI testing is limited to a few platforms.  Download and test the program on various operating systems/versions and hardware and help identify gaps that our limited development and testing may have missed. Specific high priority testing needs include:
  * Windows systems with over 64 logical processors
  * Raspberry Pi
  * Less common Linux distributions
* Contributing code.  See something that's not working right or could work better?  Help us fix it!  New contributors are welcome.
* Documenting implementation.  Our Wiki is sparse and the `oshi-demo` artifact is a place to host proof-of-concept ideas.  Want to help new users follow in your footsteps?
* Suggesting new features.  Do you need OSHI to do something it doesn't currently do?  Let us know.
