OSHI is a free JNA-based (native) Operating System and Hardware Information library for Java.
It doesn't require the installation of any additional native libraries and aims to provide a 
cross-platform implementation to retrieve system information, such as OS version, processes, 
memory & CPU usage, disks & partitions, devices, sensors, etc.

OSHI provides lightweight Java objects to enable the core functionality in the `oshi-core` module,
and extends that with flexible, configurable JSON-formatted data in the `oshi-json` module.

Supported platforms 
--------------------------- 
Windows • Linux • Mac OS X • Unix (Solaris, FreeBSD) 

Essentials
----------
* [Find OSHI on Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.github.oshi)
* [FAQ](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/FAQ.md) • [API](http://oshi.github.io/oshi/apidocs/) • [Site](http://oshi.github.io/oshi/) 
* [Upgrading from an earlier version?](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/UPGRADING.md) 

Supported features 
--------------------------
* Computer System and firmware, baseboard 
* Operating System and Version/Build
* Physical (core) and Logical (hyperthreaded) CPUs 
* System and per-processor load % and tick counters
* CPU uptime, processes, and threads
* Process uptime, cpu, memory usage
* Physical and virtual memory used/available
* Mounted filesystems (type, usable and total space)
* Disk drives (model, serial, size) and partitions
* Network interfaces (IPs, bandwidth in/out)
* Battery state (% capacity, time remaining)
* Connected displays (with EDID info)
* USB Devices
* Sensors (temperature, fan speeds, voltage)

Output
-------------
OSHI provides output directly via java methods or, for the `oshi-json` project, in JSON format for each of its interfaces.
By periodically polling dynamic information (e.g., every second), users can calculate and track changes.

The `main()` method of [SystemInfoTest](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/oshi-core/src/test/java/oshi/SystemInfoTest.java) 
provides sample code demonstrating the use of `oshi-core` interfaces to retrieve information and calculate additional metrics such as the below examples.

For `oshi-json`, [SystemInfoTest](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/oshi-json/src/test/java/oshi/SystemInfoTest.java) 
enables the same capabilities via decorator classes. 
See [oshi.json.properties](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/oshi-json/src/test/resources/oshi.json.properties) 
for a sample properties configuration file to customize JSON results.

Where are we?
-------------
[OSHI originated](http://code.dblock.org/2010/06/23/introducing-oshi-operating-system-and-hardware-information-java.html) 
as a platform-independent library that did not require additional software and had a license compatible with 
both open source and commercial products. We've developed a strong core of features on major Operating Systems, 
but we would love *you* to help by:
* Testing!  Download and test the program on different software and hardware and help identify gaps that our limited development and testing may have missed.
* Contributing ports.  Have an OS that's not covered? It's likely one of the existing ports can be slightly modified.
* Contributing code.  See something that's not working right or could work better?  Help us fix it!  New contributors welcome.
* Documenting implementation.  Our Wiki is blank.  Want to help new users follow in your footsteps?
* Suggesting new features.  Do you need OSHI to do something it doesn't currently do?  Let us know.
