Oshi is a free JNA-based (native) operating system information library for Java. It doesn't require any additional native DLLs and aims to provide a cross-platform implementation to retrieve system information, such as version, memory, CPU, disk, battery, etc.

Essentials
----------
* [Download Oshi 1.4](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|com.github.dblock|oshi-core|1.4|jar)
* [Download Oshi 1.5-SNAPSHOT](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/github/dblock/oshi-core/1.5-SNAPSHOT/)
* [View the API](http://dblock.github.io/oshi/apidocs/)
* [View the Site](http://dblock.github.io/oshi/)

Where are we?
-------------
Oshi is a young project. We'd like *you* to contribute ports, and help implement more methods, and suggest new features. Read the [project intro](http://code.dblock.org/introducing-oshi-operating-system-and-hardware-information-java).

Current supported platforms
---------------------------
- Windows
- Linux
- Mac OS X

Current supported features
--------------------------

### Operating Systems ###
* Manufacturer (GNU/Linux, Microsoft, Apple)
* OS (Linux Distribution, Windows, Mac OS X)
* OS Version (Version number, Codename, Build)

### Hardware ###
* How much physical/available (free+reclaimable) RAM
* How many Logical CPUs (core * thread)
* CPU uptime, load % and tick counters
* Battery state (% capacity, time remaining)
* File stores (usable and total space)

How is this different from ...
------------------------------

* [Sigar](http://sigar.hyperic.com): 
	* Sigar uses [JNI](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/index.html) which requires a native DLL to be installed. Oshi uses [JNA](https://github.com/twall/jna) and doesn't require a native DLL to be installed. 
	* Sigar is licensed under Apache 2.0 license. Oshi is distributed under the EPL license.
	* The last stable release of Sigar (1.6.4) was in 2010. Oshi is under active development as-of 2015.
* [OperatingSystemMXBean](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jre/api/management/extension/com/sun/management/OperatingSystemMXBean.html)
	* The `com.sun.management` MXBean may not be availabile in non-Oracle JVMs.
	* The MXBean has very few methods that address system-wide statistics.
	* Oshi provides significantly more information than the OperatingSystemMXBean
