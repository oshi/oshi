Oshi is a free JNA-based (native) operating system information library for Java. It doesn't require any additional native DLLs and aims to provide a cross-platform implementation to retrieve system information, such as version, memory, CPU, disk, battery, displays, etc.

Essentials
----------
* [Find Oshi on Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|oshi-core)
* [Download Oshi 2.1.2](https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.github.dblock&a=oshi-core&v=2.1.2&e=jar) (Read [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) if upgrading from version 1.x.)
* [Download Oshi 2.2-SNAPSHOT](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=com.github.dblock&a=oshi-core&v=2.2-SNAPSHOT&e=jar)
* [View the API](http://dblock.github.io/oshi/apidocs/)
* [View the Site](http://dblock.github.io/oshi/)
* Dependencies:
	* [Java Native Access (JNA)](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna)
	* [Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J)](http://www.slf4j.org/)

Where are we?
-------------
Oshi is a young project. While we've developed a strong core of features on major Operating Systems, we'd like *you* to contribute ports, and help implement more methods, and suggest new features. Read the [project intro](http://code.dblock.org/2010/06/23/introducing-oshi-operating-system-and-hardware-information-java.html).

Current supported platforms
---------------------------
- Windows
- Linux
- Mac OS X

Current supported features
--------------------------

### Operating Systems ###
* Manufacturer (GNU/Linux, Microsoft, Apple)
* OS (Linux Distribution, Windows, Mac OS X)
* OS Version (Version number, Codename, Build)

### Hardware ###
* How much physical/available (free+reclaimable) RAM
* How many Physical (core) and Logical (core * thread) CPUs 
* CPU uptime, load % and tick counters
* CPU temperature, fan speeds, voltage (if available; some OS's, some CPUs)
* Battery state (% capacity, time remaining)
* File stores (usable and total space)
* Connected displays (with EDID info)

How is this different from ...
------------------------------

* [Sigar](http://sigar.hyperic.com): 
	* Sigar uses [JNI](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/index.html) which requires a native DLL to be installed. Oshi uses [JNA](https://github.com/twall/jna) and doesn't require a native DLL to be installed. 
	* Sigar is licensed under Apache 2.0 license. Oshi is distributed under the EPL license.
	* The last stable release of Sigar (1.6.4) was in 2010. Oshi is under active development as-of 2016.
* [OperatingSystemMXBean](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jre/api/management/extension/com/sun/management/OperatingSystemMXBean.html)
	* The `com.sun.management` MXBean may not be availabile in non-Oracle JVMs.
	* The `MXBean` has very few methods that address system-wide statistics.
	* Oshi provides significantly more information than the `OperatingSystemMXBean`.
