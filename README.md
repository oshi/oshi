OSHI is a free JNA-based (native) operating system and hardware information library for Java. It doesn't require any additional native DLLs and aims to provide a cross-platform implementation to retrieve system information, such as version, memory, CPU, disk, battery, displays, etc.

Essentials
----------
* [Find OSHI on Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|oshi-core)
* [Download OSHI 2.4](https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.github.dblock&a=oshi-core&v=2.4&e=jar) (Read [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) if upgrading from version 1.x.)
* [Download OSHI 2.5-SNAPSHOT](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=com.github.dblock&a=oshi-core&v=2.5-SNAPSHOT&e=jar)

Currently supported features 
--------------------------
* Operating System and Version/Build
* Physical (core) and Logical (hyperthreaded) CPUs 
* System and per-processor load % and tick counters
* CPU uptime, processes, and threads
* Process uptime, cpu, memory usage
* Physical and virtual memory used/available
* Network interfaces (IPs, bandwidth in/out)
* Battery state (% capacity, time remaining)
* Disk drives (model, serial, size)
* File stores (usable and total space)
* Connected displays (with EDID info)
* Sensors (temperature, fan speeds, voltage)

Output
-------------
OSHI provides output directly via java methods or in JSON format for each of its interfaces.
By periodically polling dynamic information (e.g., every second), users can calculate and track changes.

The `main()` method of [SystemInfoTest](https://github.com/dblock/oshi/blob/master/src/test/java/oshi/SystemInfoTest.java) provides sample code demonstrating
the use of the interfaces to retrieve information and calculate additional metrics such as the below examples.

General information about the operating system and processor.

By measuring ticks (user, nice, system, idle, iowait, and irq) between time intervals, percent usage can be calculated.
Java MXBean and per-processor information is also provided.
```
CPU, IOWait, and IRQ ticks @ 0 sec:[967282, 15484, 195343, 124216619], 6176, [4054, 2702]
CPU, IOWait, and IRQ ticks @ 1 sec:[967308, 15484, 195346, 124216790], 6177, [4057, 2705]
User: 13.0% Nice: 0.0% System: 1.5% Idle: 85.5%
CPU load: 8.8% (counting ticks)

The EDID for each Display is provided. This can be parsed with various utilities for detailed information. OSHI provides a summary of selected data.
```

Where are we?
-------------
OSHI is a young project. While we've developed a strong core of features on major Operating Systems, we'd like *you* to contribute ports, and help implement more methods, and suggest new features. Read the [project intro](http://code.dblock.org/2010/06/23/introducing-oshi-operating-system-and-hardware-information-java.html).

How is this different from ...
------------------------------

* [Sigar](http://sigar.hyperic.com): 
	* Sigar uses [JNI](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/index.html) which requires a native DLL to be installed. OSHI uses [JNA](https://github.com/twall/jna) and doesn't require a native DLL to be installed. 
	* Sigar is licensed under Apache 2.0 license. OSHI is distributed under the EPL license.
	* The last stable release of Sigar (1.6.4) was in 2010. OSHI is under active development as-of 2016.
* [jHardware](https://github.com/profesorfalken/jHardware):
	* jHardware does not require [JNA](https://github.com/twall/jna) but instead uses command-line parsing.  OSHI uses some command line parsing but attempts to use native commands whenever possible.
	* jHardware presently only supports Windows and Unix systems.
	* jHardware is licensed under Apache 2.0 license. OSHI is distributed under the EPL license.
* [OperatingSystemMXBean](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jre/api/management/extension/com/sun/management/OperatingSystemMXBean.html)
	* The `com.sun.management` MXBean may not be availabile in non-Oracle JVMs.
	* The `MXBean` has very few methods that address system-wide statistics.
	* OSHI provides significantly more information than the `OperatingSystemMXBean`.
