OSHI provides output directly via Java methods for each of its interfaces.
By periodically polling dynamic information (e.g., every second), users can calculate and track changes.

You can see more examples and run the [SystemInfoTest](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/oshi-core/src/test/java/oshi/SystemInfoTest.java)
and see the full output for your system by cloning the project and building it with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html).

In addition, the `oshi-demo` project includes an [OshiGui](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/master/oshi-demo/src/main/java/oshi/demo/OshiGui.java) class implementing a basic Swing GUI offering suggestions for potential visualizations using OSHI in a UI, monitoring, or alerting application, as shown below.  For a more advanced GUI based on this approach, see the [MooInfo project](https://github.com/rememberber/MooInfo).

General information about the operating system and computer system hardware:
![Operating System and Hardware](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oshi/oshi/master/src/site/markdown/OSHW.PNG)

By measuring ticks (user, nice, system, idle, iowait, and irq) between time intervals, percent usage can be calculated.
Per-processor information is also provided.
![CPU Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oshi/oshi/master/src/site/markdown/CPU.PNG)

Process information including CPU and memory per process is available.
