Contributing to Oshi
=====================

OSHI is work of [many contributors](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/graphs/contributors). You're encouraged to submit [pull requests](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/pulls), [propose features and discuss issues](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/issues).

OSHI is [first-timers-only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) friendly.  If you're new to open source, or coding, or git, we're happy to help you get started! Look for the `first-timers-only` or `good first issue` tags on issues, or simply post a new issue asking how you can help.  We'll walk you through the steps needed to contribute to the project.

#### Fork the Project

Fork the project on Github by clicking on the word "Fork" above and to the right of this page.  This will create your own fork at https://github.com/yournamehere/oshi.git.  Then clone your fork to your local repository on your machine using these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/yournamehere/oshi.git
cd oshi
git remote add upstream https://github.com/oshi/oshi.git
```

#### Create a Branch for your feature

Make sure your fork is up-to-date and create a topic branch for your feature or bug fix.

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

#### Build and Test

Ensure that you can build the project and run tests.

```
mvn test
```

#### Write Tests

For bug fixes, try to write a test that reproduces the problem you're trying to fix (and fails).
For new features, write a test that produces results for a feature that you want to build.

We definitely appreciate pull requests that highlight or reproduce a problem, even without a fix.

#### Write Code

Implement your feature or bug fix.

Make sure that `mvn test` completes without errors.


#### Update Changelog

Add a line to [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) under *Next Release*. Make it look like every other line, including your name and link to your Github account.

#### Commit Changes

Make sure git knows your name and email address:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "contributor@example.com"
```

Writing good commit logs is important. A commit log should describe what changed and why.

```
git add ...
git commit
```

#### Push

```
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

#### Make a Pull Request

Go to https://github.com/yournamehere/oshi and select your feature branch. Click the 'Pull Request' button and fill out the form. Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days.

#### Rebase

If you've been working on a change for a while and other commits have been made to the project, rebase with upstream/master.

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git push origin my-feature-branch -f
```

#### Update CHANGELOG Again

Update the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) with the pull request number. A typical entry looks as follows.

```
* [#123](https://github.com/oshi/oshi/pull/123): Reticulated splines - [@contributor](https://github.com/contributor).
```

You may amend your previous commit and force push the changes, or just submit a changelog commit.

```
git commit --amend
git push origin my-feature-branch -f
```

#### Check on Your Pull Request

Go back to your pull request after a few minutes and see whether it passed muster with Travis-CI. 
Everything should look green, otherwise read the Travis log to identify failed tests or compile erros.
Fix issues and amend your commit as described above.

#### Be Patient

It's likely that your change will not be merged and that the nitpicky maintainers will ask you to do more, or fix seemingly benign problems. Hang on there!

#### Thank You

Please do know that we really appreciate and value your time and work. We love you, really.
